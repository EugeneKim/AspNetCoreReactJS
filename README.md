# Purpose

This project demonstrates how to consume the ASP.NET Web API with ReactJS.

## Note
I have reduced unnessary files generated by templates.

- Boilerplate code such as CSS, test components from ReactJS generated by <em>create-react-app</em> command.
- Code for SSL connection or configurations from ASP.NET Web API generated by <em>dotnet new</em> command.

This also focuses on separate projects of the server and the client to not sit them into one project.
Therefoew you can build up the projects totally separately.

## Structure

This repository consists of

- Server: ASP.NET Core Web API to provide WeatherForecast service.
- Client: React app (TypeScript) to consume the service.

### How to build

fetch the source files from repository.

Build and start the ASP.NET Web API
> dotnet build

Build and start React app
> npm install

> npm start

Those are end-points.
- Service: http://localhost:5000
- React app: http://localhost:3000

### How to play around
Start the server first then browse the client.
Click the button on the client page to consume the service.
